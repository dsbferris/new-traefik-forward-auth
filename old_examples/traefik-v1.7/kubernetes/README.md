These examples show how to deploy traefik-forward-auth alongside traefik v1.7.

The "seperate pod" examples show traefik-forward-auth in it's own pod and leave the deployment of traefik as an exercise for the user (e.g. if using helm).

The "single pod" examples show traefik and traefik-forward-auth in a single pod.

Please see the README's in each example for more details.
